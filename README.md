My KiCAD Components
===================


In here are 3 components
1) m.2 TE connector footprint
2) PCIe Schematic component
3) PCIe Molex connector footprint.

Use with caution....

Actually, you'll find more than that now, i've gotten into the habbit of dumping any
component i need into this library


Thanks to the kind folks on the KiCAD forums for the help with the M.2 Connector:
