My KiCAD Components
===================


In this git repo are a number of components

# Footprints
1) HR911105a (taken from https://github.com/Guzunty/Pi and updated for the A version - 0.9mm diff in the led pins)
2) M.2 NGFF connector from TE

# Schematic Components
1) FE2.1 (7 port usb hub chip - works well)
2) FTDI FT230XS (usb to uart)
3) SP232ACN-L (MAX232 like chip, UART to RS232)
4) two extra 3.3v lines
5) ADP2303 (DC/DC buck convertor/switch reg)
6) FSUSB20 (fairchild chip for switching between 2 usb busses)

Use with caution....

Actually, you'll find more than that now, i've gotten into the habbit of dumping any
component i need into this library


Thanks to the kind folks on the KiCAD forums for the help with the M.2 Connector:
